			<h1>My Work</h1>
			<p>Greetings! My name is Ledmics and I have a passion for programming. I am dedicated to expanding my skills and knowledge by exploring new programming languages. This page serves as a platform for me to showcase my projects and will be regularly updated to reflect my recent work.</p>

        <div class="headless window" name="Steam">
            <h1>Python</h1>
			<h2>Lambdapi</h2>
            <p><a href="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1039972532897460327/1071592860194967642/image.png">This</a> is a python wrapper I developed for the social media site Lambdageneration, it simplifies automating the site to a couple of lines of code.</p>
            <h2>PyEngine</h2>
            <p>I have also attempted to create an engine inspired by those that power games such as hollow knight, this resulted in <a href="https://github.com/ledmic/Pyengine">Pyengine</a></p>
            <h2>15 Minute code Challenges</h2>
            <p>These are short challenges I do to teach myself a language faster, <a href="https://github.com/ledmic/CSS-Checker">This</a> is the first of that series, a quick program to check if a person owns a specific game on the online retail store steam.</p>
            <hr>
            <h1>C/C++ Projects</h1>
            <h2>Raycasters</h2>
            <p>I created a raycaster in an attempt to learn C, <a href="https://github.com/ledmic/OpenGL-Raycaster">This</a> was written 100% solo.</p>
            <h2>Physics Engines</h2>
            <p>I wanted to create a 2D physics engine, inspired by that of Jolt or Havok, the end result was <a href="https://github.com/ledmic/olcEngine-Physics">This</a>, which let the controller spawn balls with basic physics, and drag across lines to act as ramps.</p>
            <h2>Console 3D Rendering</h2>
            <p>More experiments to become familier with C++, <a href="https://github.com/ledmic/Console-3D-Renderer">This</a> is a console app that draws a spinning ascii cube.</p>

					<p>I was introduced to programming at the age of six or seven by my father and have since been continuously honing my skills on a daily basis, driven by a desire to continually improve.</p>
